# Progress Report

Follow the instructions precisely. If it wasn't specified, don't do it.

## Write Current Progress

CREATE or UPDATE a file named @.claude/TODO.md in the project root with the current development progress. Keep each item as concise as possible.

### File Structure:

Write the progress report using the following template:

```markdown
# TODO List

## Completed

- [List completed features/tasks with checkmarks]
- [x] [Specific completed item]
- [x] [Another completed item]

## In Progress

- [Current task being worked on]
- [Percentage complete if applicable]
- [Any blockers or challenges]

## Next Steps

- [ ] [Upcoming task 1]
- [ ] [Upcoming task 2]
- [ ] [Priority items]

### Update Frequency:

Execute this command:

- After completing a major feature or milestone
- Before ending a coding session
- When switching between different parts of the project
- After encountering and resolving significant challenges

### Important Guidelines:

- Be concise but informative
- Include specific file names and function names when relevant
- Note any decisions that might affect future development
- Keep previous entries if appending (consider using date headers)
- Use clear, actionable language for TODO items
```
